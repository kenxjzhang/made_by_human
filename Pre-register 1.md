### Have any data been collected for this study already?
No data has been collected for this study yet.
### What's the main question being asked or hypothesis being tested in this study?
**Main Research Question:**  How does disclosing the use of Generative AI at different stages (information gathering, analysis, recommendation) in preparing an investment report affect an investor's acceptance of the report's recommendation?
### Describe the key dependent variables specifying how they will be measured.
The key dependent variable is the participant's incentivized investment decision. After reading the investment report, participants will be asked to choose one of three companies (disguised with pseudonyms) in which to invest. The report will explicitly recommend one of these three companies.

For the primary analysis, this categorical variable will be coded as a binary outcome:
- 1 = The participant chose the company that was explicitly recommended in the report.
- 0 = The participant chose one of the two other (i.e., non-recommended) companies.
### How many and which conditions will participants be assigned to?
Participants will be randomly assigned to one of nine experimental conditions. Eight of these conditions consist of a 2 (Information Gathering: AI vs. No AI) x 2 (Analysis: AI vs. No AI) x 2 (Recommendation: AI vs. No AI) between-subjects factorial design. The ninth condition is a 'No Disclosure' group, where I remove the "Generative AI Disclosure" section in the investment report. Each participant will only be exposed to one of the nine conditions.
### Specify exactly which analyses you will conduct to examine the main question/hypothesis.
In all models, I will use OLS regression analysis with a binary dependent variable (i.e. linear probability models).

**Primary analysis:** 
The primary analysis will focus on the eight factorial conditions to test the main research question regarding the impact of using AI at different stages. The 'NoAI/NoAI/NoAI' condition will serve as the baseline for these comparisons.

In the first set of models, the dependent variable will be the binary outcome of choosing the recommended company (1 = yes, 0 = no).

The independent variables will be binary variables representing the main effects of the three experimental factors (AI used in Information, AI used in Analysis, AI used in Recommendation).

The coefficients for these binary variables will represent the effect of using AI at each stage on the probability that a participant will follow the recommendation. For instance, a significant negative coefficient for the 'AI in Analysis' variable would suggest that participants are less likely to follow the recommendation when the analysis involves AI. 

A second set of models will be analyzed to examine the effects of specific experimental combinations. The main independent variables will be seven binary variables, each representing a unique factorial condition (e.g., 'NoAI/NoAI/AI', 'NoAI/AI/AI'). The 'NoAI/NoAI/NoAI' condition will be omitted to serve as the baseline reference group.

The coefficient for each binary variable will represent the change in the probability of following the recommendation for that specific condition, relative to the baseline. For example, a significant negative coefficient on the 'NoAI/AI/AI' binary variable would indicate a lower likelihood of participants following the recommendation under this condition (i.e., AI in analysis and recommendation stages only) compared to the baseline where AI is not used in any stage.

**Secondary analysis:** 
To explicitly test the effect of Generative AI disclosure itself, the secondary analysis will directly compare the 'No Disclosure' condition with the 'NoAI/NoAI/NoAI' condition. The analysis examines whether the showing AI disclosure has an effect on the probability that a participant will follow the report recommendation.
### Specify exactly how outliers will be defined and handled, and your precise rules for excluding observations.
Participants who fail to complete the entire survey or withdraw their consent for participation upon debriefing will be excluded from the analysis.

### How many participants will be recruited?
1200
### Anything else you would like to explore?
I will conduct a series of planned exploratory analyses to understand the potential mechanisms driving the results. 

**Exploratory Mechanism Analysis:** I will use mediation analysis to test whether the effect of the AI disclosure conditions on the investment decision is mediated by any of the following five potential mechanisms. The five proposed mediators are:

1. Effort heuristic
2. Novelty deficit
3. Impaired accountability
4. Black-box discomfort
5. Hallucination risk      

Each of these potential mechanisms is measured with multiple 7-point Likert-style survey items, which will be combined to form a scale for each potential mechanism. I will use both causal mediation analysis and bootstrapping method to examine the mediation effects.

**Exploratory Moderation Analysis:** I will examine whether the main effect of AI disclosure is moderated by participants' demographic characteristics, including age, gender, occupation, income level, prior investment experience, and self-reported usage of AI tools. I will include the interaction of each factor and the AI disclosure binary variable in the OLS regression. The coefficient of the interaction term is the moderating effect of demographic characteristics.

### As predicted pre registration
### Have any data been collected for this study already?
No data has been collected for this study yet.
### What's the main question being asked or hypothesis being tested in this study?
**Main Research Question:**  Do people trust content differently depending on how AI is used? Specifically, we ask how does disclosing the use of Generative AI at different stages (information gathering, analysis, recommendation) in preparing an investment report affect an investor's reliance on that report's recommendation?

**Main Hypothesis:** Participants who are told that Generative AI was involved in the analysis and/or recommendation stages of the report's creation will be significantly less likely to follow the report's primary investment recommendation, compared to participants in the baseline condition where all stages are attributed to a human analyst. We predict that the negative effect of AI disclosure will be strongest for these higher-order cognitive tasks.
### Describe the key dependent variables specifying how they will be measure.
The key dependent variable is the participant's incentivized investment decision. After reading the investment report, participants will be asked to choose one of three companies (Company A, Company B, or Company C) in which to invest. The report will have explicitly recommended one of these three companies.

For our primary analysis, this categorical variable will be coded as a binary outcome:
- 1 = The participant chose the company that was explicitly recommended in the report.
- 0 = The participant chose one of the two other non-recommended companies.
### How many and which conditions will participants be assigned to?
Participants will be randomly assigned to one of eight experimental conditions in a 2 (Information Gathering: AI vs. No AI) x 2 (Analysis: AI vs. No AI) x 2 (Recommendation: AI vs. No AI) between-subjects factorial design. Each participant will only be exposed to one of the eight conditions.
### Specify exactly which analyses you will conduct to examine the main question/hypothesis.
To test our main hypothesis, we will conduct a logistic regression or OLS regression analysis.

- The dependent variable will be the binary outcome of choosing the recommended company (1 = yes, 0 = no).
    
- The independent variables will be dummy codes representing the main effects of the three experimental factors (AI used in Information, AI used in Analysis, AI used in Recommendation).
    
- Our main hypothesis will be supported if the coefficients for the 'AI_Analysis' and 'AI_Recommendation' dummy variables are statistically significant and negative, indicating a lower probability of choosing the recommended company when AI is disclosed in those stages, relative to the human-only baseline.
    
- We will also examine the full model including all two-way and three-way interaction terms. As a secondary test, we will use planned contrasts to compare the "pure human" control condition directly against specific AI-involved conditions.
### Specify exactly how outliers will be defined and handled, and your precise rules for excluding observations.
Participants who fail to complete the entire survey or withdraw their consent for participation upon debriefing will be excluded from the analysis.

### How many participants will be recruited?
1200
### Anything else you would like to explore?
Yes. While our primary registered hypothesis is confirmatory and focuses on the main behavioral outcome, we will conduct a series of planned exploratory analyses to understand the psychological drivers of our results. These analyses will be treated as exploratory and hypothesis-generating.

- **Exploratory Mechanism Analysis:** We will use mediation analysis to test whether the effect of the AI disclosure conditions on the investment decision is mediated by our five proposed psychological mechanisms. The five proposed mediators are:
    
    1. Perceived Effort
    2. Perceived Originality
    3. Perceived Accountability
    4. Perceived Transparency
    5. Perceived Reliability
        
- **Exploratory Moderation Analysis:** We will explore potential moderation effects. Specifically, we will examine whether the main effect of AI disclosure is moderated by participants' demographic characteristics, such as their prior investment experience and their self-reported familiarity and usage of AI tools.
