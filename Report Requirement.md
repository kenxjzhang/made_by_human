# Why financial report?
A good question asked by Andy
The report structure is coherent with the McKinsey’s famous SCR method of consulting: Situation, Complication, and Resolution.

# Writing for the paragraph
I choose financial analysis report in my study. 
Financial analysis report is ideal for several reasons.
- First, financial analysis is a multi-layered decision making process. 
	From professional to retail investors, the procedure of making an investment needs different stages of thought process. 
	An investor would first look at the business fundamentals, analyze the trend, and finally make the decision.

- Second, the outcome is can be objectively measured and incentivized.
	In the study, participants are asked to make an investment decision that links with their bonus in the study.
	It is difficult to design an incentivized study in evaluating articles, artworks.
	In many scenarios, the absolute quality of the product is difficult to measured and thus hard to incentivized.
	Some studies used the awards or auction prize as a measure of artworks, but they are still not as straightforward as investment returns. 

- Third, financial advice is an example of many information service industry. The key in these jobs are recommending and gain trust from their customers. The objective quality is difficult to measure, and the subjective trust is more important.


### Report Requirement
**Role of Information: Establishing a Common Foundation of Reality**
Its core task is to answer the question: "**What are we talking about?**" This section is not about showcasing the comprehensiveness of data collection, but about bringing you and the reader into the same "room" to ensure you are looking at the same thing. Before evaluating anything, we must first have a common, undisputed understanding of it. The information section is this "stage-setting" phase; it clears away ambiguity and provides a solid foundation for all subsequent discussion. If this foundation is not secure, the analysis and recommendations that follow will be like a castle built on sand.

**Role of Analysis: Providing an Objective Framework for Comparison**

Its core task is to answer the question: "**How are they different, and what are their pros and cons?**" This is the logical core of the entire report. Its purpose is not to persuade, but to **demonstrate**. Here, you place the three companies on the same scale, weighing them from the same set of dimensions (such as growth, profitability, advantages). This process must be **neutral and transparent**. You must act like a detective, presenting all the evidence, both positive and negative, to the reader. The function of this part is to build your **credibility**, as it shows the reader your thought process. Here, the reader follows along with you in examining the evidence, rather than passively listening to a conclusion.

**Role of Recommendation: Making a Responsible Final Judgment**

Its core task is to answer the final question: "**So, which one should we choose?**" This is the destination of the entire journey. Its purpose is not to repeat the evidence from the analysis, but to make a **comprehensive, subjective judgment** based on that evidence. If analysis is "seeing all the paths," then recommendation is "pointing out the best one to take." This section is a manifestation of **courage and wisdom**; it converges the preceding objective, divergent comparisons into a single, clear directive for action. It gives the entire report its ultimate meaning and value—to help the reader make a decision.
### Requirements for the Report:
There are three distinctive sections in the report: information, analysis, and recommendation.
The information section shows the fundamentals of business and the financial information. The analysis goes deep into the patterns of the information and analyze why pattern happen (e.g. why the revenue drops, why they decide to invest large in certain business). The recommendation gives final recommendation of one of the three companies. It is giving investor a clear recommendation why they should buy one of the three companies instead of the other two. It is okay to put in caution and analyze the bull/bear forecast. But still, here it is less about the analyzing but about recommendation. 

Timeline:
- In the writing, we treat the report was created in January 2025. We don't provide any information after January 2025, and all our analysis are based on the available information with cutoff in January 2025.
Goal:
- Write a financial recommendation report with information, analysis, and recommendation to moderately financially knowledgable participants to invest in their money. They want to use the report to pick one of the three companies mentioned in the report to have highest return from January 2025 to July 2025.
Industry:
- It should be neutral and not evoke excessive personal moral preference. (blank skate)
- Somewhat easy to understand. Should not be involved too much complicated business model.
- A little bit far away from the daily life of most people, such that people will use the report to help make their decisions. It helps to reduce the excessive prior preference.
Audience: 
- The report must be written for a moderately financially literate adult. The language should be clear, direct, and professional.
Clarity over Jargon: 
- Avoid overly technical financial or industry jargon. Explain the "so what?" behind the data. For instance, instead of just "P/S ratio is 15x," state "The company is valued at a high 15 times its sales, indicating high market expectations for future growth."
Objectivity (in Sections 1 & 2): 
- The tone in the Information and Analysis sections should be objective and balanced.
Brevity: 
- The entire report should be concise and easily readable within a few minutes (approx. 600-800 words).

Current selection of companies:
- Industry of talent search (https://gemini.google.com/app/6f0d06fc023ae25f)
- Coffee roaster? 
- Retailed business seems to be generally good 


Example:

What are the concerns for the report?
- "These look so unprofessional" 
	- We pre-tested it the experiment: x percent of people actually think it is professional. If not, then we are going to change the facade of the stock investment report.
- "The report is not helpful in my own investing"
	- We are going to also pre-test it with the question "Could you briefly explain your rating? What, if anything, made the report feel particularly realistic or unrealistic?"

# I would also want to make sure that the reports follow the similar structures 
### **Guideline for Creating Future Investment Reports**

This guideline provides a template and best practices for creating additional, comparable reports for the experiment. The goal is to maintain a consistent structure and quality while varying the specific companies and industry.

**1. Overall Structure** Each report must follow the same three-part structure:

- **Part 1: Information:** Introduce the companies and present factual data.
    
- **Part 2: Analysis:** Compare the companies' strategies, strengths, and weaknesses.
    
- **Part 3: Recommendation:** Make a clear, decisive recommendation for one company and justify it.
    

**2. Content Principles**

- **Create Three Distinct Narratives:** For each report, select three real companies and build a clear, memorable story around each one. Examples:
    
    - The "Stable Giant vs. The Nimble Innovator vs. The Turnaround Story"
        
    - The "High-Risk/High-Reward Tech Play vs. The Defensive Dividend Payer vs. The Balanced Grower"
        
- **Maintain a Balanced Argument:** The core of the report's credibility lies in the **Analysis** section. It must present a balanced case. Each company should have plausible strengths and weaknesses. The goal is to create a realistic decision-making scenario, not a simple "right vs. wrong" choice. The recommendation should feel like a well-reasoned judgment, not an obvious conclusion.
    
- **Use Professional and Neutral Language:**
    
    - **Do:** Employ industry-standard terminology (e.g., "market capitalization," "balance sheet," "cyclicality").
        
    - **Don't:** Use overly strong, subjective, or leading words. Instead of saying a decision was "puzzling" or "brilliant," describe the decision and its market reception objectively (e.g., "The decision introduced uncertainty among investors" or "The move was well-received by the market").
        
- **Ensure Data Plausibility:** All financial figures (revenue, profit, debt, etc.) should be based on real, publicly available data to ensure they are realistic and internally consistent (e.g., a company's market cap should make sense relative to its revenue and net income).
    

**3. Section-Specific Guidelines**

- **Introduction:**
    
    - Start with a brief overview of the industry.
        
    - Introduce the three companies.
        
    - End with a clear statement of the report's purpose.
        
- **Information Section:**
    
    - Provide a short, factual paragraph describing each company's business model.
        
    - Include a standardized financial metrics table. Ensure all data is from a consistent time period (e.g., "FY 2024") and that any notes are applied consistently across all companies for a professional feel.
        
- **Analysis Section:**
    
    - This is the most important section for building a credible argument.
        
    - Use comparative sub-headings (e.g., "Growth Drivers and Headwinds," "Financial Health") to structure the analysis.
        
    - Directly compare and contrast the companies on these dimensions. Avoid discussing each company in isolation.
        
- **Recommendation Section:**
    
    - Begin with a clear, bolded statement declaring the recommended company.
        
    - Briefly explain why the other two companies were _not_ chosen, addressing their primary risks or near-term headwinds.
        
    - Provide 2-3 clear, bulleted reasons to justify the recommendation. These reasons should directly follow from the points made in the **Analysis** section.
        
    - End with a concise concluding sentence that summarizes the investment thesis.
        

By adhering to this template, we can ensure that every report used in the study is a high-quality, credible, and standardized stimulus, which will significantly strengthen the validity and reliability of our experimental findings.
